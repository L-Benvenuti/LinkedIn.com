# LinkedIn.com
Unfortunately, after years of using LinkedIn (at least since 2017), my profile simply vanished. Since I had been working on it
for so long, I got frustrated and decided to recreate what my page would most likely look like if it was still up and running.
 -- Of course it does have a little extra details, but I mean, if it looks better... then why not?
